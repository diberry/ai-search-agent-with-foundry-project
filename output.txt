❓ Follow-up question: How do I find lava at night?
[{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[{\"ref_id\":0,\"content\":\"<!-- PageHeader=\\\"Volcanoes\\\" -->\\n\\n## Volcanoes\\n\\n### The Infrared Glows of Kilauea's Lava Flows—Hawaii\\n\\nIn early May 2018, an eruption on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano began to unfold. The eruption took a dangerous turn on May 3, 2018, when new fissures opened in the residential neighborhood of Leilani Estates. During the summer-long eruptive event, other fissures emerged along the East Rift Zone. Lava from vents along the rift zone flowed downslope, reaching the ocean in several areas, and filling in Kapoho Bay.\\n\\nA time series of Landsat 8 imagery shows the progression of the lava flows from May 16 to August 13. The night view combines thermal, shortwave infrared, and near-infrared wavelengths to tease out the very hot lava (bright white), cooling lava (red), and lava flows obstructed by clouds (purple).\\n\\n#### Figure: Location of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii\\n\\nA globe is shown centered on North America, with a marker placed in the Pacific Ocean indicating the location of Hawaii, to the southwest of the mainland United States.\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\\\"Earth at Night\\\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\\\"44\\\" -->\"},{\"ref_id\":1,\"content\":\"For the first time in perhaps a decade, Mount Etna experienced a \\\"flank eruption\\\"—erupting from its side instead of its summit—on December 24, 2018. The activity was accompanied by 130 earthquakes occurring over three hours that morning. Mount Etna, Europe’s most active volcano, has seen periodic activity on this part of the mountain since 2013. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite acquired the main image of Mount Etna on December 28, 2018.\\n\\nThe inset image highlights the active vent and thermal infrared signature from lava flows, which can be seen near the newly formed fissure on the southeastern side of the volcano. The inset was created with data from OLI and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8. Ash spewing from the fissure cloaked adjacent villages and delayed aircraft from landing at the nearby Catania airport. Earthquakes occurred in the subsequent days after the initial eruption and displaced hundreds of people from their homes.\\n\\nFor nighttime images of Mount Etna’s March 2017 eruption, see pages 48–51.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Hazards of Volcanic Ash Plumes and Satellite Observation\\n\\nWith the help of moonlight, satellite instruments can track volcanic ash plumes, which present significant hazards to airplanes in flight. The volcanic ash—composed of tiny pieces of glass and rock—is abrasive to engine turbine blades, and can melt on the blades and other engine parts, causing damage and even engine stalls. This poses a danger to both the plane’s integrity and passenger safety. Volcanic ash also reduces visibility for pilots and can cause etching of windshields, further reducing pilots’ ability to see. Nightlight images can be combined with thermal images to provide a more complete view of volcanic activity on Earth’s surface.\\n\\nThe VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) on polar-orbiting satellites uses faint light sources such as moonlight, airglow (the atmosphere’s self-illumination through chemical reactions), zodiacal light (sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust), and starlight from the Milky Way. Using these dim light sources, the DNB can detect changes in clouds, snow cover, and sea ice:\\n\\n#### Table: Light Sources Used by VIIRS DNB\\n\\n| Light Source         | Description                                                                  |\\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Moonlight            | Reflected sunlight from the Moon, illuminating Earth's surface at night      |\\n| Airglow              | Atmospheric self-illumination from chemical reactions                        |\\n| Zodiacal Light       | Sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust                                    |\\n| Starlight/Milky Way  | Faint illumination provided by stars in the Milky Way                        |\\n\\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), managed by NOAA, orbit over Earth’s equator and offer uninterrupted observations of North America. High-latitude areas such as Alaska benefit from polar-orbiting satellites like Suomi NPP, which provide overlapping coverage at the poles, enabling more data collection in these regions. During polar darkness (winter months), VIIRS DNB data allow scientists to:\\n\\n- Observe sea ice formation\\n- Monitor snow cover extent at the highest latitudes\\n- Detect open water for ship navigation\\n\\n#### Table: Satellite Coverage Overview\\n\\n| Satellite Type          | Orbit           | Coverage Area         | Special Utility                              |\\n|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|\\n| GOES                   | Geostationary   | Equatorial/North America | Continuous regional monitoring              |\\n| Polar-Orbiting (e.g., Suomi NPP) | Polar-orbiting    | Poles/high latitudes      | Overlapping passes; useful during polar night|\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Weather Forecasting and Nightlight Data\\n\\nThe use of nightlight data by weather forecasters is growing as the VIIRS instrument enables observation of clouds at night illuminated by sources such as moonlight and lightning. Scientists use these data to study the nighttime behavior of weather systems, including severe storms, which can develop and strike populous areas at night as well as during the day. Combined with thermal data, visible nightlight data allow the detection of clouds at various heights in the atmosphere, such as dense marine fog. This capability enables weather forecasters to issue marine advisories with higher confidence, leading to greater utility.

Some of Earth's most spectacular light shows are natural, like the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, in the Northern Hemisphere (aurora australis, or Southern Lights, in the Southern Hemisphere). The auroras are natural electrical phenomena caused by charged particles that race from the Sun toward Earth, inducing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere and creating the appearance of streamers of reddish or greenish light in the sky, usually near the northern or southern magnetic pole.

[ASSISTANT]: 
To locate lava at night, thermal imaging satellites such as Landsat 8 or VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) can be used
 These instruments capture the infrared glow of lava flows, distinguishing hot lava from cooler surroundings
 For example, during eruptions, glowing lava appears bright white or red in these images, allowing scientists to monitor active volcanic sites remotely
 Additionally, moonlight and satellite thermal sensors can enhance visibility of volcanic activity, even through clouds or ash plumes
 Monitoring tools like these are especially helpful for tracking hazards and ensuring public safety
