Suburban belts show larger December brightening because seasonal and residential/holiday lighting adds a high relative increase to areas that normally have moderate baseline illumination, whereas urban cores already have very high absolute light (so the same added lights produce a smaller relative change and core skyglow and sensor saturation limit observed increases) [ref_id:1][ref_id:2]. The Phoenix street grid is sharply visible from orbit because regular, closely spaced street lighting and bright nodes at intersections in a grid produce concentrated, contiguous radiance while long interstate stretches between Midwestern cities have sparser lighting, less commercial/intersection illumination and more unlit corridor (rivers and rural areas remain dark), so highways appear comparatively dim; sensor radiometry limits (blooming/saturation) and differences between radiance versus relative-change metrics also make bright urban centers appear less variable than suburban neighborhoods at night [ref_id:2][ref_id:1][ref_id:0].

Phoenix is situated in the central part of Arizona, which is in the southwestern region of the United States.\n\n---\n\n### Grid of City Blocks-Phoenix, Arizona\n\nLike many large urban areas of the central and western United States, the Phoenix metropolitan area is laid out along a regular grid of city blocks and streets. While visible during the day, this grid is most evident at night, when the pattern of street lighting is clearly visible from the low-Earth-orbit vantage point of the ISS.\n\nThis astronaut photograph, taken on March 16, 2013, includes parts of several cities in the metropolitan area, including Phoenix (image right), Glendale (center), and Peoria (left). While the major street grid is oriented north-south, the northwest-southeast oriented Grand Avenue cuts across the three cities at image center. Grand Avenue is a major transportation corridor through the western metropolitan area; the lighting patterns of large industrial and commercial properties are visible along its length. Other brightly lit properties include large shopping centers, strip malls, and gas stations, which tend to be located at the intersections of north-south and east-west trending streets.\n\nThe urban grid encourages growth outwards along a city's borders by providing optimal access to new real estate. Fueled by the adoption of widespread personal automobile use during the twentieth century, the Phoenix metropolitan area today includes 25 other municipalities (many of them largely suburban and residential) linked by a network of surface streets and freeways.\n\nWhile much of the land area highlighted in this image is urbanized, there are several noticeably dark areas. The Phoenix Mountains are largely public parks and recreational land. To the west, agricultural fields provide a sharp contrast to the lit streets of residential developments. The Salt River channel appears as a dark ribbon within the urban grid.\n\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->\n<!-- PageNumber=\"88\" -->",

City lights illuminate the layout of several cities and major thoroughfares.\n\n**Labeled Urban Features:**\n\n- **Phoenix:** Central and brightest area in the right-center of the image.\n- **Glendale:** Located to the west of Phoenix, this city is also brightly lit.\n- **Peoria:** Further northwest, this area is labeled and its illuminated grid is seen.\n- **Grand Avenue:** Clearly visible as a diagonal, brightly lit thoroughfare running from Phoenix through Glendale and Peoria.\n- **Salt River Channel:** Identified in the southeast portion, running through illuminated sections.\n- **Phoenix Mountains:** Dark, undeveloped region to the northeast of Phoenix.\n- **Agricultural Fields:** Southwestern corner of the image, grid patterns are visible but with much less illumination, indicating agricultural land use.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The overall pattern shows a grid-like urban development typical of western U.S. cities, with scattered bright nodes at major intersections or city centers.\n- There is a clear transition from dense urban development to sparsely populated or agricultural land, particularly evident towards the bottom and left of the image.\n- The illuminated areas follow the existing road and street grids, showcasing the extensive spread of the metropolitan area.\n\n**Figure Description:**  \nA satellite nighttime image captured on March 16, 2013, showing Phoenix and surrounding areas (including Glendale and Peoria). Major landscape and infrastructural features, such as the Phoenix Mountains, Grand Avenue, the Salt River Channel, and agricultural fields, are labeled. The image reveals the extent of urbanization and the characteristic street grid illuminated by city lights.\n\n---\n\nPage 89",

    "page_chunk": "# Urban Development\n\n## Figure: Location Highlight on Globe\n\nThis figure depicts a globe focused on North America, with a marker pinpointing the central region of the United States. The highlighted location represents the geographical focus of the text discussion on US urban development and transportation networks.\n\n---\n\n## Urban Development\n\n### Lighting Paths—Across the United States\n\nThe United States has more miles of roads than any other nation in the world—4.1 million miles (6.6 million kilometers) to be precise, which is roughly 40 percent more than second-ranked India. About 47,000 miles (75,639 kilometers) of those roads are part of the Interstate Highway System, established by President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. The country also has 127,000 miles (204,000 kilometers) of railroad tracks and about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) of navigable rivers and canals (not including the Great Lakes). The imprint of that transportation web becomes easy to see at night.\n\nThe VIIRS DNB on the Suomi NPP satellite acquired this nighttime view (top image, right) of the continental United States on October 1, 2013. The roadway map (bottom image, right) traces the path of the major interstate highways, railroads, and rivers of the United States. Comparing the two images, you quickly see how the cities and settlements align with the transportation corridors. In the early days of the republic, post roads and toll roads for horse-drawn carts and carriages were built to connect eastern cities like Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, though relatively few travelers made the long, unlit journeys. Railroads became the dominant transportation method for people and cargo in the middle of the nineteenth century, establishing longer links across the Nation and waypoints across the Midwest, the Great Plains, and the Rockies. Had nighttime satellite images existed in that era, they probably would show only dim pearls of light around major cities in the east and scattered across the country; the strands of steel tracks and cobbled roads that connected them would be invisible from space.\n\nEventually, cars and trucks became the dominant form of transportation in the United States. Drivers then needed roads and lighting to keep them safe on those roads. As the Nation grew in the twentieth century, the development of new cities and suburbs often conformed to the path of the interstate highways, adding light along the paths between the cities.\n\nOver the years, the length of navigable rivers has been a constant, as is their relative lack of light. Even today the only light seems to be the occasional port cities along riverbanks and the light of ships themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Table: Summary of U.S. Transportation Infrastructure**\n\n| Infrastructure Type     | Total Mileage (mi) | Total Mileage (km) |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Roads (All)            | 4,100,000          | 6,600,000          |\n| Interstate Highways    | 47,000             | 75,639             |\n| Railroads              | 127,000            | 204,000            |\n| Navigable Rivers/Canals| 25,000             | 40,000             |\n\n---\n\n<!-- PageFooter=\"108 Earth at Night\" -->",
